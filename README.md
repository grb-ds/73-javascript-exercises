## The Mission

The folder consists of 73 exercises, divided into 11 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a _relatively_ logical way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.
